## STAR WARS CHARACTERS

# React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS

## To run this application make sure node is installed on you device

# Run # yarn in the root folder in the terminal to install all dependencies

# Run # yarn dev once all dependencies have been installed to run the app locally at http://localhost:5173/

## Relevant notes about this project

# The original api has changed since the initial project was created which lead to a different end result

# The app is fully responsive for mobile usage and fetches 10 characters from the api in order of pagination

# For filtering and serching purposes, all characters are fetched once separately to this and stored

# Only once all characters are loaded does the option to search and filter become available to the user

# As the updated api user object is incredibly simple, there isn't much to filter, so for now that is listed as 'Coming soon...'

## Technical considerations

# As detailed in the challed I chose to use React as the library/framework

# I chose vite in conjuntion with react for increased perfomance and developer experience

# TS was used in lieu of JS to help with error reduction and identification in code

# Tailwind was used as an easy to use, powerful modular version of CSS

# HeadlessUI was used for it's transition component for various animations

# Redux toolkit was used for global state management as integrated nicely with React:

# Global state is useful with lots of data and multiple compopnents

# Redux also integrates nicely with thunks for fetching and storing global data and loading and error states

# Redux logger is also very useful for the developer expereince and debugging
